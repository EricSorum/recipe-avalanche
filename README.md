Recipe Avalanche

This app uses the spoonacular.com API to search recipes by ingredients. By pressing one of the ingredient buttons, the user gets a list of recipes using that ingredient.

Most recipe sites require significant loading, ad closing, and scrolling just to view one recipe. By extracting only the most essential data from JSON files, Recipe Avalanche provides an image, the ingredients, and instructions for dozens of recipes in an instant.

Features also include a set of buttons to choose how many recipes to list in the search, and a search bar to find recipes for any ingredient.
